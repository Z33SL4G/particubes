    A `Palette` is a list of [BlockProperties] entries describing the visual properties of its owner [Shape]'s blocks.
    
    The entries of a palette can be changed at runtime with a few specific caveats:
    - only colors that are unused by the shape can be removed from its palette,
    - setting an entry's color directly may affect other shapes in the scene unless the owner shape was created with `sharedColors = false` or after setting [Palette.SharedColors](#property-sharedcolors) to `false`,
    - changing the [BlockProperties.Light] or [BlockProperties.Color]'s alpha values will only be reflected on the baked lighting after calling `shape:ComputeBakedLight` (as of 0.0.47, only relevant for [Map])
    
properties:
    - name: "SharedColors"
      type: "boolean"
      description: |
          Indicates whether colors in [This] can be shared with other shapes in the scene. This optimization feature is `true` by default.
          
          If you intend on changing [BlockProperties]' color at runtime, you may consider creating your shape using `sharedColors = false`.
          
          Alternatively, you can set [This.SharedColors] to `false` and only changing colors added _after_ the shape creation will be non-shared.
