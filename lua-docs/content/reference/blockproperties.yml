    `BlockProperties` describes possible properties for a [Block].

    In most cases, [BlockProperties] are `read-only`.

    Except entries in [Config.MapPaletteOverrides](/reference/config#property-mappaletteoverrides), to override map block properties for a game.

    [BlockProperties] in [Map.LocalPalette](/reference/map#property-localpalette) can also be set at any time as long as the block is opaque and not light emissive.

properties:
    - name: "Color"
      type: "Color"

    - name: "Light"
      type: "boolean"
      description: "Indicates if the [Block] is light emissive. Light color is tight to the color of the [Block]."

    - name: "ID"
      type: "number"
      description: "BlockProperties' index in the [Palette] or [array] it belongs to."
