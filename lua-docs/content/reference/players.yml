      Players is a table containing all [Player]s who joined the game.

      [Player]s are indexed by their "player ID". Player IDs range from 0 to 15.

      ⚠️ Don't use `ipairs` for iterating over `Players`, but only `pairs`.
  - code: |
      for id, player in pairs(Players) do
        -- id and player.ID have the same value here
        print(id, player.ID, player.Username)
      end
