type: "Box"
description: |
    A Box represents a volume axis-aligned to a given space : it is defined with only two [Number3], a minimum and a maximum, which represent the extents of the box along the axes of that space.

    For example, a [Shape].[BoundingBox](/reference/shape#property-boundingbox) is axis-aligned to the model space of that shape, pertaining to its blocks.
    However, an [Object].[CollisionBox](/reference/object#property-collisionbox) is axis-aligned to the world space of the scene, like most physics-related boxes.

    When using or creating an axis-aligned Box, be mindful of what space it is relevant to.
